This is a tester for huffman compression. 
It is quite long, and will hoppefully compress the contents of this text file very well. 
This program first takes in the values from this text file and then processes how many 
distinct characters exist in the text file along with their frequencies. 
Then the codes are generated by using a priority queue to create a mini heap. The tree 
is created from the node class and then they are traversed to find the code for each 
individual character. Now it is as simple as replacing each and every character into 
the binary codes that were given to them earlier!
